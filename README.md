## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

My submission of Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Term 1- Project 2: Traffic Sign Recognition. This project uses Tensorflow to build a convolutional neural net to recognize traffic signs. 

Overview
---
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

You might need to follow instructions on [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit) before running the notebook.

Furthermore, it's best to run the code on a GPU.
